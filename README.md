# SDL1_OpenTron_electrodeposition
This is the repository for the work done by external PhD researcher, Nis Fisker-BÃ¸dker from the Danish Technical University (DTU).
The software combines the use of an openTron OT2 and a Sparkfun Arduino to produce a facility for AI optimised electrodeposition of Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) catalyst for watersplitting in alkaline environment.
